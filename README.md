# Discrete choice under limited attention
Implementation of multi-class discrete choice model with limited attention. 

This package implements the limited attention discrete choice estimator in [Abaluck and Adams (2018)](https://som.yale.edu/sites/default/files/DiscreteChoiceInattention_master.pdf) and extends it to allow for multiple consumer types as descibed in [Iscenko (2020)](https://ziscenko.net/files/familiarity_latest.pdf).

The current version is **work in progress**. It is a hobby project that does not have a stable update timetable.
